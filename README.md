**Voice Assistance App**
This project is a Python-based voice assistant named "Ninja" capable of executing 12 distinct voice commands. It leverages the speech_recognition library for speech-to-text conversion and the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality.

**Features**
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text with an 80-90% accuracy rate under optimal conditions.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Responds vocally with an average response time of 0.5-1 second.
Voice Commands:
Provides information like its name, age, and creator.
It tells the current time in HHMM AM/PM format.
Opens 3 popular websites (YouTube, Google Translate, LinkedIn).
It tells jokes, with over 50 jokes available from the Pyjokes library.
Plays a song from a directory containing N songs (e.g., 50 songs).

### Customization: Designed to be easily extendable, allowing the addition of unlimited new commands.

Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries:
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition pyjokes
Installation time is estimated at 1-2 minutes depending on your internet speed.

### Usage
Run the Script: Execute the script to start the voice assistant. The script has a startup time of approximately 2-3 seconds.
Trigger the Assistant: Say "ninja" to activate the assistant, with a detection accuracy of 95% for the trigger word.
Give Commands: The assistant can recognize and execute commands such as:
"What is your name?" (Response time: 0.5-1 second)
"How old are you?" (Response time: 0.5-1 second)
"Tell me a joke." (Response time: 1-2 seconds)
"Open YouTube." (Response time: 2-4 seconds)
"Play a song." (Response time: 3-5 seconds)
"What time is it?" (Response time: 1 second)
"Exit" to stop the assistant (Shutdown time: 1 second).

### Code Explanation
sptext() Function
This function captures audio input through the microphone, with a listening duration of 5 seconds per command, and converts it to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
speechtx(x) Function
This function converts text to speech, typically taking 0.5-1 second to process and output the response.

**Main Logic**
Trigger Word: The assistant waits for the trigger word "ninja," which it detects with 95% accuracy.
Command Processing: The assistant continuously listens for commands, processes them within 1-3 seconds, and responds with voice output.
Exit Command: Saying "exit" will terminate the loop and stop the assistant, which happens almost instantaneously.
